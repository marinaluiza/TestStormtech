# Sorting Service Technical Assessment

## Introduction

This is a java application for sorting books. You can insert your own books and choose what attributes to compare (title, author or/and edition year) and the direction you prefer as well (ascending or descending).

## Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 7 or latest;
* Ubuntu 16.04 (you can run in another operation system, but you have to download the appropriate JRE).

## Run

	Using the terminal as root:
	$ sudo su
	
	Change to the directory of this repository you just cloned:
	$ cd path/to/SortingService/
	
	Copy the jre jar file to the directory in which you want to install:
	$ cp path/to/SortingService/jre-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz /path/to/java/ (jre-8u91-linux-i586.tar.gz for Linux x86)
	
	Enter at the directory:
	$ cd /path/you/want
	
	Unpack the tarball and install Java:
	$ tar zxvf jre-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz
	
	Run the application:
	$ /path/to/java/jre1.8.0_91/bin/java -jar /path/to/SortingService/SortingService.jar
